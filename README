TODO: Arch problems stem from lack of proper domain model
Create a domain model suitable for the UI structure (eg. no ad-hoc conversions for the tree component)
Create transforms to go from the DTO to the domain and back.

ROADMAP:

## MVP

- [ ] Streamline grammar model
  - [ ] Merge container and value types
- [ ] Editor controls for the grammar
  - [ ] Change node type
  - [ ] Move node in list (drag and drop)
- [ ] HexView cursor & selection behavior
- [ ] Create nodes with selection on hexview
- [x] Fix scroll behavior bug
- [ ] Edition in hex view

## Nice to have

- Scroll locking of grammar and structure views

## Later

- Text mode edition of grammars
- Parsing in a worker
