ROADMAP:

## MVP

- Editor controls for the grammar
- HexView cursor & selection behavior
- Create nodes with selection on hexview
- Fix scroll behavior bug
- Edition in hex view

## Nice to have

- Scroll locking of grammar and structure views

## Later

- Text mode edition of grammars


Performance notes:

- use tree-like data structures whose unchanged branches are ref-equal. Pass this data structure down tree-like components. use React.memo to avoid re-renders.
