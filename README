TODO: Arch problems stem from lack of proper domain model
Create a domain model suitable for the UI structure (eg. no ad-hoc conversions for the tree component)
Create transforms to go from the DTO to the domain and back.

ROADMAP:

## MVP

- Editor controls for the grammar
- HexView cursor & selection behavior
- Create nodes with selection on hexview
- Fix scroll behavior bug
- Edition in hex view

## Nice to have

- Scroll locking of grammar and structure views

## Later

- Text mode edition of grammars
