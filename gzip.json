For systems which have different file formats for ascii text and binary data, the decompressor can use FTEXT to choose the appropriate format. We deliberately do not specify the algorithm used to set this bit, since a compressor always has the option of leaving it cleared and a decompressor always has the option of ignoring it and letting some other program handle issues of data conversion." },
